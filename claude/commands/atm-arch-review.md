   - Coupling and cohesion analysis
   - Microservices boundaries (if applicable)
   - API design and versioning
   - Event-driven architecture
   - Domain-driven design alignment
   - Dependency injection patterns

### 6. **DevOps & Infrastructure**
   - CI/CD pipeline configuration
   - Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
   - Container strategy (Docker, Kubernetes)
   - Monitoring and observability
   - Deployment strategies
   - Environment configuration
   - Backup and disaster recovery
   - Service mesh considerations

### 7. **Compliance & Standards**
   - Industry standards compliance (ISO, SOC2)
   - Regulatory compliance (GDPR, HIPAA)
   - Accessibility standards (WCAG)
   - Coding standards adherence
   - License compliance
   - Open source dependency management

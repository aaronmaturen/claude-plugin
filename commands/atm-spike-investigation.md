   ‚Üí Continued poor mobile UX, increased server costs

üîß TECHNICAL SCOPE:
1. Which parts of the system are in scope?
   ‚Üí Mobile API endpoints, user dashboard APIs
2. Are there any specific technologies to evaluate?
   ‚Üí Apollo GraphQL, Relay, GraphQL Yoga
3. What are the current pain points we're addressing?
   ‚Üí N+1 queries, over-fetching, multiple API calls per page load
4. Are there any constraints or limitations?
   ‚Üí Must maintain backward compatibility with existing REST APIs

üî¨ RESEARCH AREAS:
1. What specific questions need answering?
   ‚Üí Migration complexity, performance impact, developer experience
2. What alternatives should be compared?

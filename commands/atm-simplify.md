# Code Simplification Analysis

Analyze codebase (or specific section) for complexity and consistency using 5 specialized sub-agents. Each agent performs 3 iterative passes to identify and suggest simplifications while maintaining alignment with existing patterns.

**Target Path:** $ARGUMENTS (defaults to current directory)

## Sub-Agent Framework:

### 1. **Pattern Consistency Agent**
Ensures code follows established patterns in the codebase.

**Pass 1 - Pattern Discovery:**
- Identify common patterns across the codebase:
  - Naming conventions (variables, functions, classes)
  - File organization patterns
  - Import/export structures
  - Error handling patterns
  - API response patterns
  - Component structure patterns

**Pass 2 - Deviation Detection:**
- Find code that deviates from established patterns
- Identify inconsistent implementations of similar functionality
- Detect mixed paradigms (e.g., callbacks vs promises vs async/await)
- Find naming convention violations

**Pass 3 - Standardization Proposals:**
- Suggest refactoring to match dominant patterns
- Provide specific code changes to align with conventions
- Prioritize changes by impact and effort

### 2. **Code Complexity Agent**
Identifies and reduces unnecessary complexity.

**Pass 1 - Complexity Metrics:**
- Calculate cyclomatic complexity for each function
- Identify deeply nested code blocks (>3 levels)
- Find functions with too many parameters (>4)
- Detect overly long functions (>50 lines)
- Identify complex conditional statements

**Pass 2 - Simplification Opportunities:**
- Functions that can be decomposed
- Complex conditionals that can use early returns
- Nested callbacks that can be flattened
- Switch statements that can use lookup tables
- Loops that can use functional approaches

**Pass 3 - Refactoring Recommendations:**
- Provide specific refactoring suggestions
- Show before/after code examples
- Estimate complexity reduction
- Ensure functionality preservation

### 3. **DRY Principle Agent**
Eliminates code duplication and promotes reusability.

**Pass 1 - Duplication Detection:**
- Find exact code duplicates
- Identify similar code patterns with minor variations
- Detect repeated logic across files
- Find duplicated type definitions
- Identify copy-pasted error handling

**Pass 2 - Abstraction Opportunities:**
- Common functions that can be extracted
- Shared utilities that should be centralized
- Repeated patterns that need templates
- Similar components that can be generalized
- Duplicate configs that can be merged

**Pass 3 - Consolidation Plan:**
- Create shared utility modules
- Suggest generic implementations
- Provide migration path for duplicates
- Estimate code reduction metrics

### 4. **Abstraction Level Agent**
Ensures appropriate levels of abstraction.

**Pass 1 - Abstraction Analysis:**
- Identify over-engineered solutions
- Find premature optimizations
- Detect unnecessary design patterns
- Locate overly generic implementations
- Find abstraction layer violations

**Pass 2 - Simplification Targets:**
- Abstractions used only once
- Interfaces with single implementations
- Factory patterns for simple objects
- Unnecessary inheritance hierarchies
- Over-configured systems

**Pass 3 - De-abstraction Proposals:**
- Suggest direct implementations
- Remove unnecessary layers
- Simplify configuration systems
- Inline single-use abstractions
- Balance flexibility vs complexity

### 5. **Dependency Simplification Agent**
Optimizes dependencies and coupling.

**Pass 1 - Dependency Analysis:**
- Map import/require statements
- Identify circular dependencies
- Find unused dependencies
- Detect over-coupling between modules
- Analyze external package usage

**Pass 2 - Optimization Opportunities:**
- Unused imports to remove
- Circular dependencies to break
- Tightly coupled modules to decouple
- External packages that can be replaced with native code
- Heavy dependencies used for simple features

**Pass 3 - Restructuring Plan:**
- Suggest dependency injection where needed
- Provide decoupling strategies
- Recommend native alternatives
- Show impact on bundle size
- Ensure no functionality loss
